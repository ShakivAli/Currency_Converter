# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Currency Converter App

This is a simple currency converter app built with React that allows users to convert currencies based on the latest exchange rates. The app fetches currency exchange rate data from the Fixer API and provides a user-friendly interface for currency conversion.

## Features

- **Input Amount**: Users can enter the amount they want to convert.

- **Currency Selection**: Users can select the currencies they want to convert from and to using dropdown menus.

- **Flip Currencies**: The app provides a button to quickly switch between the selected currencies.

- **Conversion**: Users can click the "Convert" button to calculate and display the converted amount.

- **Last Updated Information**: The app displays the date of the last update for the exchange rate data.

## Components Used

- **React Hooks (useState, useEffect)**: Used for managing state and handling side effects such as API data fetching.

- **Fetch API**: Utilized the `fetch` function to retrieve exchange rate data from the Fixer API.

- **React Components**: Divided the app into functional components for better organization and readability.

# Note : If it gives error in fetching, Please allow Insecure Content from your browser for this website.
